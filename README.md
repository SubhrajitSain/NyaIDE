## How to Install:
### on Linux

1. Download the linux executable
2. Put all the files in the `assets` folder in this repository to `/etc/NyaIDE`
3. Make a .env file in `/etc/NyaIDE`, i.e., `/etc/NyaIDE/.env`
4. In the .env file, write the following:
   ```bash
      GEMINI_API_KEY=[YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY]
   ```
   Where `[YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY]` is the actual Google Gemini API key that you can get from [here](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys).
   This is required for Neko (the AI assistant) to function. This is completely optional. NyaIDE uses `gemini-2.5-flash`.
5. Run the executable you got. Voila! ðŸŽŠ
